title: 'Is it still worth it to be a software engineer in 2025?'

> tldr; yes

The reality is that it’s really tough right now to be a software engineer. 
The job market is sluggish, job listings expect us to use AI, and with AI, 
companies expect to hire fewer engineers. Many don’t want to 
hire Junior Developers anymore. If you’re a fresh graduate expecting to start
working and learn on the job—well, there aren’t many who want to hire you now. 
What you need to prepare before graduating is to build up your portfolio, practice 
a lot, fill your GitHub profile with projects you’ve built before graduating,
demonstrate that you can actually code, 
seriously learn languages (English is a must; Mandarin/Japanese if possible),
and join developer communities like the [Google developer group](https://developers.googleblog.com/id/calling-all-students-learn-how-to-become-a-google-developer-student-club-lead/). 
Join groups like these to build connections. 
Even though our roles are technical,
to grow a career we still need to communicate our skills to others.
As you near graduation, look for big companies that still accept juniors/interns 
like [Shopee](https://careers.shopee.co.id/students).

In conclusion, a career as a software developer is still good,
but the barrier is higher. 
Back then, as fresh grads we could get by with just the basics and no real 
project experience, still get into tech, and learn on the job.
Now expectations are higher—fresh grads need real project experience.

## But... what about the prospects for the experienced???
Well… actually, for truly senior software engineers it’s even hotter now,
especially at least at the tech lead level. 
With AI, many new startups are popping up, and at the early stage they’re always 
looking for senior engineers who can build the tech team’s culture. 
But these new startups are usually so early and expect the team to be lean, 
and they expect you to be hands-on coding to cover for the small team.

Basically, senior engineers are now expected to be more productive,
more all-around, more of a jack-of-all-trades, 
compared to before when we were pushed to specialize. 
Now startups prefer more generalist senior engineers.

## What about the money?
Well… so far, from what I’ve personally heard, if you can reach a certain seniority level, 
Indonesians can still get foreign-level salaries while living in Jogja LOL. 
If you want to go abroad, many are willing to sponsor us—Japan, for example, 
is very aggressive about recruiting Indonesian developers to relocate and work there.
There are also many remote opportunities. Startups now realize work doesn’t have to be
in-office, and they operate lean—so instead of renting an office, 
they’d rather hire extra developers and work remotely.

## AI Opium
Yes, AI is changing the tech job market right now, and in my opinion this won’t change—AI will stay in the software engineering profession whether you like it or not. If we want to keep working as software developers,
we have to embrace the AI opium—at least learn how to use it: 
how to instruct AI, how to give AI functions (agentic workflows), 
and so on—there’s a lot of AI jargon slop nowadays.

Personally, I feel AI is still far from replacing the role of software engineers, 
and this year I feel AI companies have hit a limit. 
Unless there’s a near-term breakthrough in silicon/GPUs, 
it’s still far from replacing the role of software engineers. 
In my experience, AI so far is mostly useful for autocomplete, creating configs, 
setting up CI/CD pipelines, and making React templates/components 
(it’s good for React/HTML; other frameworks are less so). 
For things more complex than that, it’s still far from truly useful.

## So is it worth it or not?
In short, if you’re just starting to become a software engineer purely for the money,
it’s probably tough right now—might as well go into mining/petroleum engineering LOL,
the money is clearer. But if you want to be a software engineer because you like coding, 
computers, tech overall, and problem solving, it’s still very worth it.
Expectations are just higher now: you need to be able to use AI, debug AI code
(which honestly isn’t pleasant to read), and
handle tasks that might not be your specialty, etc. And AI is an unfinished, 
ever-evolving technology. This year we use AI for X, Y, Z; next year a new model 
might change things again. We’ll have to update prompts, fine-tune again, and so on.
It’s a never-ending learning cycle. Some people I know quit being developers because 
the new trends never stop. So make sure you know what you’re getting into.
